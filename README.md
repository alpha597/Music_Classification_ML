# Music_Classification_ML
Classify music dataset using Machine Learning algorithms using Tensorflow and Skicit-learn

this classification is done by several features of music- tempo, loudness, beats, pitch, root mean square error, spectral_centroid, zero_crossing rate etc.
Extra features extracted from audio files, using librosa library of Python 
Classifying music into 10 generes - Classical , blues, rock, country, metal , pop, jazz etc. It music genre has it's own feature combination and we  want to classify the dataset into 10 groups. At first we have used the Support Vector machine(SVM) algorithm both linear and rbf model
below is accuracy of this model -confusion matrix

next algorithm to apply -KNN, K-Means Clustering, Neural networks... etc
